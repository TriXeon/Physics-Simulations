This file contains code of solving 3 body systems and them making a animated simulation
here we havave used Ranga kutta method to solve the Newton's Equation of motion and then find and create the array of positions and time which we then use to simulate the system using matplotlib's funcanimation.
here are some figures of the simulation

we can also use vpython for better smoooth visualization
